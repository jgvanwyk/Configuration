Configuration
=============

My configuration files and scripts.

Description
-----------

Some of my configuration files are written in the m4 language to facilitate generating appropriate configuration files for different operating systems and keeping secrets private.

Usage
-----

To generate the configuration files, run `make`, and to install them, run `make install`. Consult the `Makefile` for a list of variables that affect the generated files.
